# Winter is coming grid-world

The grid-world switches between summer and winter,
a group of players struggle to be alive, making alternated moves. 

The players need to possess 'credits' to be alive, if a player run out of credits, dies

from time to time, 'energy points' appear in the field, that players can collect. 

there is a group of houses where the players can shelter in winter-time,
in winter a player looses credits if it's not inside a house.

Only one player can be in a house. 
If the house is owned by other player, the player has to pay rent, otherwise the player might choose to buy it. 

from time to time, every player loose credits. 
players spend credits to move around.
